This program performs taxonomy binning using output from FR-HIT.
The algorithm is based on LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor).

=== File list ===
README: this file.
binning.py: the program file
bacteria_gitax.pkl: GI to taxonomy ID mapping for bacteria sequences
                    in Python pickle format.
tax.pkl: Entire NCBI Taxonomy tree in Python pickle format.
example.sh: example script to run the program.
example.frhit: example FR-HIT output file as input to this program.
example.binning: binning output for input example.frhit

=== Requirements ===
Because this program relies on GI numbers to get taxonomy information
of hits, the hit names in column 9 of FR-HIT's output must contain
    gi|#####|
where ##### is the gi number.

=== How to run it ===
python binning.py [options] input_file output_file

Running the program itself without any arguments
    python binning.py
or
    python binning.py -h
shows the help message.

=== Output format ===
Each output line is in the following format:
    READ_NAME    DETERMINED_TAXONOMY_LEVEL   COMPLETE_TAXONOMY_LINEAGE
where

DETERMINED_TAXONOMY_LEVEL is the lowest taxonomy level we can determine
for each read, in the following format:
    (Taxonomy ID:Taxonomy Name:Rank)

COMPLETE_TAXONOMY_LINEAGE is the lineage for the determined taxonomy
level starting from 'root', in the following format:
    [Taxonomy ID:Taxonomy Name:Rank|...|...|Taxonomy ID:Taxonomy Name:Rank]

=== Limitations ===
-Due to file size limit, we only provide GI to Taxonomy mapping for
bacteria sequences.
-The current algorithm is very simplistic without considering statistical
distribution of species. We'll use a more sophisticated algorithm in
future versions.
