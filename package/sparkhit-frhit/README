Current version: 0.7

The current version supports:

1. Multithreads parallel computing using OPENMP.
2. PSL output format.
3. Mask of low-complexity regions as lower cased sequences in reference database.
4. E-value cutoff.

Three perl scripts:

psl2sam.pl: transfer PSL format to SAM format.(This script is from samtools package)
frhit2pairend.pl: analysis FR-HIT output to get pair-end alignment information
binning-1.1.1: This program package performs taxonomy binning using output from FR-HIT. The algorithm is based on LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor).

FR-HIT is an efficient fragment recruitment algorithm for next generation sequences against microbial reference genomes. It produces similar sensitivity of BLASTN, but runs at a 100 times higher speed. We applied FR-HIT, BLAST and several other alignment programs to recruit an Illumina dataset of 1 million 75-bp reads selected from a recent human gut microbiome study (Qin J, et al. Nature 2010, 464:59) to 194 public human gut bacterial reference genomes. BLAST recruited 475,584 reads and found 6,134,663 alignments in 241.5 hours. Mapping program BWA used 0.1 hours, but only produced 212,699 recruitments. FR-HIT recruited 523,868 reads and identified 5,780,580 alignments in 1.8 hours.

       -d   <string>   reference genome sequences file, *.fasta format
       -o   <string>   output recruitments file
       -e   <double>   e-value cutoff, default=10
       -u   <int>      mask out repeats as lower cased sequence to prevent spurious hits? 1: yes; 0: no; default=1
       -f   <int>      format control for output file,0:FR-HIT format; 1:PSL fromat, default=0
       -k   <int>      k-mer size (8<=k<=12), default=11
       -p   <int>      k-mer overlap of index (1<=p<-k), using small overlap for longer reads(454, Sanger), default=8
       -c   <int>      sequence identity threshold(%), default=75
       -g   <int>      use global or local alignment? 1:global; 0:local (need -m), default=0

       -m   <int>      minimal alignment coverage control for the read (g=0), default=30
       -l   <int>      length of throw_away_reads, default=20
       -t   <int>      maximum number of failed alingment attempts, default=20
       -r   [0,N]      how to report alignment hits, 0:all; N:the best top N hits for one read, default=0
       -n   <int>      do alignment for which chain? 0:both; 1:direct only; 2:complementary only. default=0
       -b   <int>      band_width of alignment, default=4
       -T   [0,N]      number of threads, default 1; with 0, all CPUs will be used
       -h   help

example:

./fr-hit -a 454reads-sample.fa -d 1000bacterialgenomes.fasta -c 90 -m 40 -w 120 -r 0 -o out.sop


The default output format of FR-HIT recruitment result file looks like:

ReadName	ReadLength	E-value	AlignmentLength	Begin	End	Strand	Identity	ReferenceSequenceName	Begin	End

FR-HIT supports PSL output format and users can also use psl2sam.pl to convert PSL format to SAM format.
